# Persona 5 Royal Battle Music Randomizer

This mod hijacks BGM calls for Take Over, Last Surprise, and Triumph, and redirects them to new cue IDs (60962 for Take Over & Last Surprise, 60963 for Triumph). The new cue IDs contain multiple tracks and are set to 'shuffle' which results in randomized battle and victory themes during gameplay. Only normal battles will have their battle theme randomized, but all battles should have randomized victory themes.

Steam-only; untested on Gamepass.
